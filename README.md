# Pair Partner

During this task I was paired with Julian Veling, his profile can be viewed at: https://github.com/veliancreate

We were able to complete the specification and add some extra functionality:

* Background colour changes shade on every temperature increment. A basic algorithim is used to change the RGB values.
* A visual thermometer added to the page which also responds accordingly to the temperature increments.

# Future Enhancements

* Make page fully responsive

# Getting Started

Clone the repo with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/robertpulson/thermostat.git`

Then use `cd thermostat` to navigate to it.

To open the test suite in the browser enter `open specrunner.html`.

Run the page with `open index.html` but be careful not to leave the temperature too high.

Ignorance is bliss...
